--------------------------------------------------------                 CALL FOR PAPERS        The 5th International Workshop on  Massively Multiuser Virtual Environments (MMVE 2012)     at the 11th IEEE International Symposium on    Audio-Visual Environments and Games (HAVE 2012)               October 08-09, 2012                 Munich, Germany         http://peers-at-play.org/MMVE12/--------------------------------------------------------Massively Multiuser Virtual Environment (MMVE) systems are spatial simulations that provide real-time human interactions among thousands to millions of concurrent users. MMVEs have experienced phenomenal growth in recent years in the form of massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) such as World of Warcraft and Lineage, and social communities such as Second Life and Hobbo Hotel. The technical aspect of designing, developing, and deploying them is highly interdisciplinary and involves experts from many domains, including graphics, networking, protocol and architecture designs. The MMVE workshop intends to provide a forum for both academic researchers and industry developers to investigate the architectural and system support for MMVEs. By gathering experts under one roof, we wish to discuss their findings, incite collaborations, and move the state of the art forward. Topics ------ The workshop seeks to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners in the field, and encourages discussions based on the presented papers to identify current and future research topics. We are particularly interested in raising discussions about the followingquestions:1. How is MMVE technology developed for games reused for distributed virtualenvironment in other domains, such as training?2. How do the life-cycles and payment models of games integrated into socialnetworking systems (Facebook etc) influence game development?3. How can MMVE technology leverage parallel computing technology, includingmulticore (Cell, GPU), tight clustering (transactional memory, distributedshared memory) and distributed systems (P2P, Clouds)?   The workshop thus will address the following issues:1. Scalability: the ability to handle at least thousands of concurrent users, interacting via Internet. 2. Interactivity: how to provide responsive, near real time interactions despite latency and jitter. 3. Consistency: providing consistent views for users, despite the inherent delay in state updates. 4. Persistence: the ability to save and access the world states despite disconnections and failures. 5. Security and privacy: distributed algorithms that allow secure interactions and privacy guarantees. 6. Interoperability: integration of multiple systems or providers with common protocols or clients. 7. Bandwidth restricted (mobile) devices: the integration of mobile devices for nomadic systems. 8. Self-organizing architectures: load balancing and fault tolerance without manual configurations. 9. Content streaming: voice communication and 3D content streaming, incremental deployment and updating.
10. Implementation issues: novel approaches to address developmentchallenges.
