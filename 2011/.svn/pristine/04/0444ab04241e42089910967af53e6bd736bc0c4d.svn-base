                                    Massively Multiuser Virtual Environment (MMVE) systems are spatial simulations that provide real-time human interactions among thousands to millions of concurrent users. MMVEs have experienced phenomenal growth in recent years in the form of massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) such as World of Warcraft and Lineage, and social communities such as Second Life and Hobbo Hotel. The technical aspect of designing, developing, and deploying them is highly interdisciplinary and involves experts from many domains, e.g., graphics, networking, protocol and architecture designs. The MMVE workshop intends to provide a forum for both academic researchers and industry developers to investigate the architectural and system support for MMVEs. By gathering experts under one roof, we wish to discuss their findings, incite collaborations, and move the state of the art forward.

														<b>Title: Challenges, Key Technologies and Potential Applications for Large Scale Web Virtual Worlds</b>  <!--[<a href="slides/Keynote.pdf">slides</a>]--><br>
														Prof. Guangzheng Fei (Communication University of China, China)<br>
														Prof. Jinyuan Jia (Tongji University, China)
														<p>
														Nowadays, authoring Web3D content on Internet has become explosively popular since VRML was published as an international Web3D standard in 1997. However, we are still faced with bottlenecks such as expensive content authoring, massive data volume, low Internet bandwidth and weak browser computing. Thus, it is still extremely challenging to construct large scale immersive virtual worlds on Web for social games or applications. This talk proposes some feasible solutions and presents five key technologies on Web3D studied by our lab recently:
														<ul>
															<li>Highly efficient, low cost and lightweight Web3D modeling;</li>
															<li>P2P progressive transmission of massive WebVR world;</li>
															<li>Highly efficient and lightweight script programming of Web interaction;</li>
															<li>Lightweight and plug-in based WebVR engine;</li>
															<li>Agile development of WebVR applications.</li>
														</ul>
														<br>
														A collaborative Web HouseDIY platform, is then used to show how to develop a large scale Web3D scenario efficiently. Web HouseDIY provides a powerful and flexible toolkit for designers, easy and suitable GUIs for users, and a hierarchical role-based mutual–communication for both professional designers and ordinary users. Furthermore, some research results and other prototypes are demonstrated to show the effectiveness of our breakthrough approach in building huge Web3D content. Finally, various applications of Web3D will be predicted in exploring massively multi-user virtual environments, haptic visual-audio environments and gaming scenarios on Web, (e.g., virtual city, virtual world, campus, E-commerce, museum, housing, tourism, GIS, social network services and MMORPG).

													<li><b>The XFire Online Meta-Gaming Network: Observation and High-Level Analysis</b> <!--[<a href="papers/p2.pdf">paper</a>, -->[<a href="slides/MMVE-1-Shen.pdf">slides</a>]<br>
														by Siqi Shen and Alexandru Iosup (Delft University of Technology, Netherlands)
														<p>
														Online Meta-Gaming Networks are Internet-based communities of (computer) game players that extend in-game functionality by focusing on the relationship between game sessions, on what happens in the meantime between game sessions, and on the relationship between games. Motivated by the popularity of these game-related networks and by the growth of their importance---many major game developers have started to operate their own online meta-gaming network---, in this work we analyze a long-term observation of XFire. Using long-term, large-scale data that we have collected, we present a high-level, marginal distribution- and time-based analysis of XFire: its global network, player activity, user-generated content, and social structure. We find that XFire is a slowly growing network whose players spend collectively in-game over 100 years, every hour. We quantify the ``hardcore''-ness of XFire players, and find that a significant fraction of them have played over 10,000 in-game hours. We also find that XFire community members are routinely engaged in the creation and consumption of game-related media, such as screenshots and videos.

													<li><b>Getting Real - Self-Organized Resource Allocation on Second Life Avatar Traces</b> <!--[<a href="papers/p8.pdf">paper</a>, -->[<a href="slides/MMVE-2-Botev.pdf">slides</a>]<br>
														by Jean Botev (University of Luxembourg, Germany), Wei Tsang Ooi (National University of Singapore, Singapore), and Ingo Scholtes (University of Trier, Germany)

													<p>
														The expedient design of resource allocation mechanisms, particularly in light of dynamically varying user densities, is an important building block for the provision of peer-to-peer massively multiuser virtual environments. In case of their decentralized operation, a meaningful analysis of a given mechanism is difficult to achieve. The most realistic and convincing way of carrying out an evaluation certainly - if not performed in vivo - is against real data. This paper provides a comparative evaluation of two self-organized resource allocation schemes against Second Life avatar traces. Collected from regions with different usage characteristics, the traces allow for a thorough analysis of the performance and behavior of the individual schemes under real churn and mobility which, so far, have been simulated for assessment. We analyze both the effectiveness of the resource allocation and the respective effects on the topology, concluding some general guidelines for the design of such decentralized mechanisms on geometric overlay networks.

													<li><b>Finding the best tradeoff between multi resolution content reproduction quality and multi resolution content distribution efficiency</b> [<a href="slides/MMVE-short-1-Cavagna.pdf">slides</a>]<br>
													by Romain Cavagna and Maha Abdallah (LIP6-CNRS, UPMC, France)
													<p>
													It is well-known that networked multi resolution contents are designed and optimized to be exchanged between a provider and one or more requesters while allowing the best possible reproduction quality to all requesters. According to participants¡¦ terminal computing resources, push or pull modes can be used to distribute the reproduction load (i.e., server scalability versus light weight clients). In the same way, peer-to-peer techniques are available to distribute the transmission load. By focusing on these two ideas, this paper raises the following question: unless it is admitted that peer-to-peer architectures allow to increase the scalability and the responsiveness of the services they support, is there a best tradeoff between multi resolution content reproduction quality and multi resolution content distribution efficiency? In other worlds, can we accurately take into account the distribution strategy at multi resolution content generation levels? The present paper does not provide an answer, but aims at achieving a first step in this direction by proposing a new dedicated C++ GPL v3 tool that serves as a NVE distributed emulation platform. This tool includes a modular multi resolution 3D histogram that can be distributed on top of centralized or peer-to-peer network architectures.

													<li><b>Specifying Consistency Requirements for Massively Multi-User Virtual Environments</b> [<a href="slides/MMVE-short-2-Itzel.pdf">slides</a>]<br>
													by Laura Itzel, Richard Sueselbeck, Gregor Schiele, and Christian Becker (University of Mannheim, Germany)
													<p>
													In this paper we discuss that the specific consistency and latency requirements of world state updates in Massively Multi-User Virtual Environments (MMVEs) are determined by several characteristic factors of the virtual world, i.e. their Interaction Context. As this context is highly application-dependent, MMVE developers require a simple specification scheme which allows them to specify these requirements for their specific Interaction Contexts. In this paper we present such a scheme, which we believe represents an important step towards dynamic and flexible consistency management for MMVEs.

													<li><b>Interactive Scalable Crowdcasting</b> [<a href="slides/MMVE-short-3-Hu.pdf">slides</a>]<br>
													by Shun-Yun Hu (Academia Sinica, Taiwan)
													<p>
													Supporting real-world activities online has been one of the main goals in applied computer science. However, the gathering of a large crowd for a specific purpose (e.g., lecture, concert, rally), has not yet moved online. The recent concept of crowdcasting (i.e., broadcasting to an audience while engaging them with real-time feedback) may pave the way towards it, but the audience scale and feedback fidelity are still limited by bandwidth and latency constraints. Increasing the availability of such resources thus can be important to support new forms of online activities. In this concept paper, we propose Interactive Multicast Overlay Network (IMON), a scalable approach to support crowdcasting where the number of participants can be potentially large, while the information content delivered can be rich. IMON is a peer-to-peer (P2P) overlay multicast that relies on idle peer bandwidth, and self-organizing structures to support scalable crowdcasting. The main design and challenges of IMON are described for future evaluations.

													<li><b>Crowd Buzz: Scalable Audio Communication for MMVEs using Latency Optimized Hypercube Gossiping</b> <!--[<a href="papers/p3.pdf">paper</a>, -->[<a href="slides/MMVE-3-Berndt.pdf">slides</a>]<br>
													by Philipp Berndt, Matthias Hovestadt, and Odej Kao (Technische Universität Berlin, Germany)
													<p>
													Audio communication for massively multiuser virtual environments (MMVEs) comprises the provision of hundreds of thousands of users with their personal, position dependent compositions of audio streams, in real-time, at low latency, using non-realtime components connected through a heterogeneous network with diversely limited bandwidths and varying delays. In lack of functioning comprehensive solutions, users resort to detached and limited conferencing tools. In this paper, we present a peer-to-peer approach with proven latency bounds, a suggested architecture, and best practices for its implementation. We test-drove our prototype using the OMNeT++ simulator in conjunction with the DELFOI delay model. First latency results indicate feasibility for domestic scenarios.

													<li><b>Pithos: A State Persistency Architecture for Peer-to-Peer Massively Multiuser Virtual Environments</b> <!--[<a href="papers/p4.pdf">paper</a>, -->[<a href="slides/MMVE-4-Gilmore.pdf">slides</a>]<br>
													by John S. Gilmore and Herman A. Engelbrecht (University of Stellenbosch, South Africa)
													<p>
													The field of state persistency for peer-to-peer massively multiuser virtual environments is explored and categorised into super peer storage, overlay storage, hybrid storage and distance-based storage. The storage types are briefly evaluated against the identified storage system requirements of scalability, fairness, reliability, responsiveness and security. All storage types are found to be lacking in some respects and therefore a novel storage system called Pithos is introduced. The design of Pithos, which is based on a multi-tiered hybrid architecture making use of grouping is presented. Preliminary results show that Pithos addresses all of the identified requirements.

                                The workshop seeks to provide a forum for researchers and practitioners in the field, and will encourage discussions based on the 
                                presented papers to identify current and future research topics. Some key and emerging issues we would especially like to solicit are:
				<ul>
					<li>The integration of MMVE with social networking systems such as Facebook and Instant Messengers. 
					<li>The adoption of parallel techniques (e.g., GPU, P2P, household set-top boxes) to increase scale.
					<li>Interoperable MMVE standards and protocols based on observations or abstractions of existing systems.
				</ul>
				More specifically, the workshop addresses the following MMVE topics:
                                <ol>
					<li>Scalability, the ability to handle at least thousands of concurrent users, interacting via Internet. 
					<li>Interactivity, how to provide responsive, near real time interactions despite latency and jitter.
					<li>Consistency, providing consistent views for users, despite the inherent delay in state updates.
					<li>Persistency, the ability to save and access the world states despite disconnections and failures.
					<li>Security and privacy, distributed algorithms that allow secure interactions and privacy guarantees.
					<li>Interoperability, integration of multiple systems or providers with common protocols or clients.
					<li>Bandwidth restricted (mobile) devices, the integration of mobile devices for nomadic systems. 
					<li>Self-organizing architectures, load balancing and fault tolerance without manual configurations. 
					<li>Content streaming, voice communication and 3D content streaming.
					<li>Implementation issues, novel approaches to effectively manage the complexity of development.
