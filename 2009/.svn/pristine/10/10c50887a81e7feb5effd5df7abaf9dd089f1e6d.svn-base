                                    With the increasing number of potential users of virtual and augmented reality systems, as indicated 
                                    by the recent boom of massively multiuser online societies, the design of distributed, massively 
                                    multiuser virtual environments becomes more and more important, posing new requirements on both 
                                    distribution platforms and virtual reality systems. Facing these challenges is a community-spanning 
                                    effort, necessitating the pooling of the resources and experiences of the virtual reality and the 
                                    networking and distributed computing communities. The aim of this workshop is to provide a link 
                                    between these communities to foster the development of highly distributed, flexible and robust
                                    virtual environments. Following up on last year’s very successful workshop (MMVE’08) at IEEE VR, we
                                    aim to gather the practitioners and researchers in these fields under one roof to discuss their 
                                    findings, incite collaboration, and move the state of the art forward.

														by Lu Fan, Hamish Taylor, Phil Trinder (Heriot-Watt University, UK)
														<p>
														Massively Multiplayer Online Games are becoming increasingly popular
														on the Internet. However, implementing them with a conventional
														Client/Server architecture suffers from various technical and commercial
														drawbacks. This has awakened research interest in adapting MMOGs to a
														Peer-to-Peer architecture. This paper surveys six essential issues in
														the implementation of a P2P MMOG. They are interest management, game
														event dissemination, NPC host allocation, game state persistency,
														cheating mitigation and incentive mechanisms.

													<li><b>Spatial Publish Subscribe</b> [<a href="papers/p8.pdf">paper</a>, <a href="slides/Hu-SPS.pdf">slides</a>]<br>
														by Shun-Yun Hu (National Central University, Taiwan)
													<p>
														Publish / subscribe is a well-known mechanism adopted by many
														applications to allow entities interested in certain information
														(i.e., the subscribers) to receive relevant messages from certain
														message generators (i.e., the publishers). We argue that for
														networked or distributed virtual environment (VE) applications,
														a spatial publish / subscribe (SPS), where each entity can
														receive messages generated within a specified space in the VE,
														is a fundamental mechanism underlying various VE applications.
														It is therefore of importance for the VE community to understand
														the main characteristics and limitations of SPS. This paper
														describes the basic mechanism of SPS, and how it can be used to
														support various existing VE requirements such as overlay management,
														state management, or content management. Potential ways to implement
														SPS are also outlined to allow interested parties to develop their
														own implementations.

													<li><b>HyperVerse - Simulation and Testbed Reconciled</b> [<a href="papers/p9.pdf">paper</a>, <a href="slides/Botev-HyperVerse.pdf">slides</a>]<br>
														by Jean Botev, Markus Esch, Hermann Schloss, Ingo Scholtes, Peter Sturm (University of Trier, University of Luxembourg)
													<p>
														When dealing with dynamic and large-scale topologies such
														as those underlying peer-to-peer (P2P) distributed virtual
														environments (DVE), one inescapably reaches the point where
														either real-life user input during simulations or experiments
														within test environments do not reach a critical mass to be
														considered strong and sustainable proof of the applied concepts.
														The restrictions resulting from the reciprocity and strict
														disjunction of simulation and test environments make it cumbersome
														to get a comprehensive assessment, and thus hinder more efficient
													  development of adaptive algorithms and techniques for DVEs as they
														are investigated in our HyperVerse research project. Within this paper
													  we present a hybrid evaluation system designed to combine the
													  advantages of simulations and experiments. The proposed infrastructure
													  exhibits great flexibility particularly alluring in view of the
													  multitude of potential research in the context of DVEs.

													<li><b>Deadline-Driven Auctions for NPC Host Allocation in P2P MMOGs</b> [<a href="papers/p3.pdf">paper</a>, <a href="slides/Fan-DDA.pdf">slides</a>]<br>
													by Lu Fan, Hamish Taylor, Phil Trinder (Heriot-Watt University, UK)
													<p>
													This paper presents the design, implementation and evaluation
													of Deadline-Driven Auctions (DDA), a novel task mapping
													infrastructure for heterogeneous distributed environments. DDA
													is primarily designed to support the hosting of Non-Player
													Characters (NPCs) in P2P Massively Multiplayer Online Games
													(MMOGs). Experimental and analytical results demonstrate that
													DDA provides four significant advantages. Firstly, it is
													self-organising as the infrastructure can be automatically
													assembled and managed. Secondly, it efficiently allocates
													computing resources for large numbers of real-time NPC tasks
													in a simulated P2P MMOG with the better part of 1000 players.
													Thirdly, it supports gaming interactivity by keeping the
													communication latency among NPC hosts and ordinary players
													low. Finally, it supports flexible matchmaking policies, and
													with a friendly incentive policy, can establish a cooperative
													economic model that helps motivate application participants
													to contribute their resources to the system.

													<li><b>QuON -- a Quad-Tree Based Overlay Protocol for Distributed Virtual Worlds</b> [<a href="papers/p4.pdf">paper</a>, <a href="slides/Krause-QuON.pdf">slides</a>]<br>
													by Stephan Krause, Helge Backhaus (Universitaet Karlsruhe, Germany)
													<p>
													Massively Multiplayer Online Games and Virtual Worlds are among
													the most popular applications on the Internet. As player numbers
													increase, the limits of the currently dominant client/server
													architecture are becoming obvious. In this paper we propose a
													new distributed event dissemination protocol for Virtual Worlds
													and MMOGs. This protocol is based upon the idea of mutual
													notification: All players send their game event messages directly
													to all neighboring players inside their Area of Interest. The
													connectedness of the system is ensured by binding neighbors.
													They are selected using quad-trees. We show by simulation that
													the proposed system achieves practical performance for Virtual
													Worlds and Massively Multiplayer Online Games.

													<li><b>Middleware Mechanisms for Interaction Interoperability in Collaborative Virtual Environments</b> [<a href="papers/p5.pdf">paper</a>, <a href="slides/Ciampi-InteractionInterop.pdf">slides</a>]<br>
													by Mario Ciampi, Luigi Gallo, Antonio Coronato, Giuseppe De Pietro (ICAR-CNR, Italy)
													<p>
														In this paper, we discuss interaction interoperability in
													Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVE), intended to mean the
													ability of two or more users to cooperate despite the heterogeneity
													of their interfaces. To allow such interoperability, rather than
													focusing on the de-coupling of input devices from interaction
													techniques and from interaction tasks, we suggest integrating
													interactive systems at higher level through an interface standardization.
													To achieve this aim, we propose: i) an architectural model able to
													handle differences in input devices and interaction tasks; ii) an
													agent-based middleware that provides basic components to integrate
													heterogeneous user interfaces. We also present a prototype of an
													agent-based middleware able to support developers in the interconnection
													of monolithic applications and we introduce tools and languages we
													have used to formalize the interaction tasks considered in the case
													study.
