		  <h3>Call for Papers</h3>
		  <p>
		  MMVE 2018 marks the 10th year anniversary of the MMVE workshop. 
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  MMVE started 10 years ago with a vision of enabling multi-user interactive 3D virtual environments on a massive scale.  
		  In recent years, technical advances have enabled many new devices, such as head mounted displays, wearable sensing devices, gesture-based input devices, that increase the level of immersion through how users experience and interact with the 3D virtual environment.   
		  At the same time, wearable displays such as smart glasses and the availability of depth-sensing cameras on mobile phones are enabling mixed reality applications.  
		  While we are moving closer to the vision of MMVE due to more users having access to 3D mixed/virtual environments with a better experience, the advances also bring new systems research challenges and opportunities: 
		  There is now more data to sense, collect, store, transmit, process, display. At the same time, there are tighter constraints on the system performance, such as interaction latency, computation power, energy, and bandwidth, due to increased immersiveness of the system, miniaturization of sensing and display devices, and an increasingly distributed nature of the system.   
		  These challenges and opportunities provide the systems research community a rich set of problems on how operating systems, distributed systems, networking systems, programming systems, data management systems, embedded systems can better support mixed or 3D virtual environment applications.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		  With this perspective, MMVE is renamed "International Workshop on I<b>M</b>mersive <b>M</b>ixed and <b>V</b>irtual <b>E</b>nvironment Systems.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		  MMVE will remain a discussion-focused workshop as a forum for researchers and practitioners in the field to discuss new ideas and to present their latest research work.  
		  Being co-located with ACM MMSys, a premier conference on multimedia systems, MMVE also provides a unique opportunity for researchers in the field, both from academia and industry, to gather and interact with systems researchers.
		  </p>

		  <h4>Scope of the Workshop</h4>
		  <p>
		  MMVE 2018 solicits papers related to various systems challenges in enabling great user experience in immersive mixed reality systems and 3D virtual environments.  In particular, research papers addressing the challenges from the perspective of one or more of the following systems aspects: 
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  <ul>
            <li><b>Operating systems and middleware</b>: high-performance OS support for capturing, storing, rendering, processing, and transmission of content
			<li><b>Networking and distributed systems</b>:  protocol and architecture for low latency, high throughput data distribution
			<li><b>Programming systems</b>: systems and tools that support developers of immersive VR/AR applications
			<li><b>Mobile and embedded systems</b>: support for tight resource constraints; novel hardware/software architecture; sensors and IoT
			<li><b>Data management systems</b>: support for high-performance data storage and retrieval
		  </ul>
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  addressing one or more of the following performance issues:
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  <ul>
              <li><b>Interactivity</b>: provide responsive, near real-time interactions and user experience despite latency or jitter
              <li><b>Scalability</b>: able to handle many interacting concurrent users, and/or devices
              <li><b>Consistency</b>: provide consistent views for users, despite the inherent delay in state updates
              <li><b>Throughput</b>: support high bandwidth transmission or techniques to reduce bandwidth requirements
              <li><b>Fault tolerance</b>: able to handle failure in one or more of the components
              <li><b>Security and privacy</b>: allow secure interactions and privacy guarantees
              <li><b>Resource constraints</b>: support mobile/wearable devices and sensors
		  </ul>
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  regarding multi-modal content:
		  <ul>
			<li><b>3D data</b>: meshes, point sets, textures etc. that constitute synthesized scenes and objects for mixed and virtual reality environments.
			<li><b>Multi-sensory data</b>: audio, visual, olfactory, haptic, and taste data that constitute data that are captured from reality and/or synthesized for rendering.
			<li><b>Environmental data</b>: information captured by other sensors that feed into the immersive application, such as user motion and position or environmental lighting conditions. 
		  </ul>
		  </p>

		  <h4>Submission Instructions</h4>
		  <p>
		  MMVE 2018 accepts both full papers and short (poster or demo) papers.
		  Full paper submissions should be 4-6 pages in length. We expect full paper submissions to be the kernel of what will eventually lead to full-length papers at high-quality conferences or journals.  Short paper submissions should be 2-3 pages in length.  We expect short paper submissions to either present a work-in-progress idea for discussions at the workshop or describe a system suitable for technical demonstration at the workshop.
		  </p>
		  
		  <p>
		  All submissions should be formatted using the standard ACM proceedings style.
		  All submissions must be blinded and constitute original, unpublished work not under review elsewhere.  Submissions will undergo a double-blind peer review process and will be selected based on their originality, merit, and relevance to the workshop.
		  Accepted papers must be presented by one of the authors at the workshop and will be archived in ACM Digital Library as part of the ACM MMSys 2018 proceedings.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		  Authors of selected papers from MMVE 2018 will be invited to submit an extended version of their papers to <a href="http://www.mmsys2018.org/participation/tomm-special-issue/">a special issue of ACM Transactions on Multimedia (TOMM)</a>.
		  </p>

		  <p>
		  Papers appearing at MMVE 2018 are eligible for the <a href="http://mmsys2018.org/participation/excellence-in-dash-award/">DASH-IF Excellence in DASH Award</a>.
